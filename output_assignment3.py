The required dictionary-- {9: 'l', 8: 'z', 1: 'j', 3: 'y'}
The list will be used in further parts--
The required list-- [(9, 'l'), (8, 'z'), (1, 'j'), (3, 'y')]
Done!
----------------(b)------------------------
The dictionary we had-
{9: 'l', 8: 'z', 1: 'j', 3: 'y'}
now we have exchanged the key value pair but its not sorted-
{'l': 9, 'z': 8, 'j': 1, 'y': 3}
The unsorted list--
[('l', 9), ('z', 8), ('j', 1), ('y', 3)]
The sorted list--
[('j', 1), ('l', 9), ('y', 3), ('z', 8)]
The sorted dictionary-
{'j': 1, 'l': 9, 'y': 3, 'z': 8}
This is the dictionary sorted on the basis of name-
{1: 'j', 9: 'l', 3: 'y', 8: 'z'}
Done!
-----------------(c)-----------------
The list we made before will be used now-
[(9, 'l'), (8, 'z'), (1, 'j'), (3, 'y')]
now the list is sorted-
[(1, 'j'), (3, 'y'), (8, 'z'), (9, 'l')]
sorted dictionary based on sid- {1: 'j', 3: 'y', 8: 'z', 9: 'l'}
Done!
